    <p>Here's a brief overview of how the application works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.</li>
        <li>Authenticated users can create and join chat groups.</li>
        <li>Users can send and receive messages in real-time, with messages being displayed instantly in the chat interface.</li>

    </ul>
